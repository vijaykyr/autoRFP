This process specifies courses of action, procedures for notification, escalation, mitigation, and documentation. To help ensure the swift resolution of security incidents, the Google information security team is available 24x7 to all Google employees.In addition, Google proactively searches for security incidents on an ongoing basis, by actively reviewing inbound security reports, monitoring public mailing lists and blog posts, and tracking automated perimeter systems. When an information security incident occurs, Google’s security staff responds promptly in a manner commensurate with the threat level.
